            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                As a passionate Electronics Engineer, I have extensive experience in the field of electronics and robotics.
                I have developed my skills through project‑based learning, competitions, internships, and research. I have worked
                on projects like a quadcopter and a CNC plotter, led a team to create an underwater robot, and taught CAD and
                PCB design to students and faculties. I have completed my major project at the Indian Space Research Organization
                (ISRO), where I worked on electronics and dashboard software development for closed‑loop control of a hexapod
                mechanism used in a space telescope. Currently, I am working at Indian Institute of Science (IISc) as a Project
                Associate focused on developing hardware of legged robotic platforms. I am committed to making meaningful
                contributions to the field and I believe that my previous experiences, combined with my strong foundation in
                electronics and robotics, will enable me to achieve bigger milestones.
